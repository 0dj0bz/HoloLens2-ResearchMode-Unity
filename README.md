# HoloLens2-ResearchMode-Unity
Unity Plugin for using research mode functionality in HoloLens 2. Modified based on HoloLens2ForCV.

Skeleton to wrap HoloLens 2 research mode api into Windows Runtime extension. 
To use it in Unity, just build the project and move the .dll and .winmd file in 'HL2UnityPlugin\ARM64\Release\HL2UnityPlugin' into Plugins folder in Unity Assets.

Still under development...
